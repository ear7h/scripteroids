# scripteroids

This is a work in progress.

The idea for this game is a simple version of asteroids, except the user
has to program the ship with (a simple langugage and) a virtual machine
that executes one instruction per time step. Some things should be tuned,
but the idea is that human and programmable players should be "on the same
level".
