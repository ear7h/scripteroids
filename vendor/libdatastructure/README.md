# libdatastructure

Yet another attempt at writting data structures.

I'm not sure if this one will hold up (3rd times a charm?). At
the very least, this one has an actual makefile and a sweet test
framework.

## roadmap

- [x] slice
    * [ ] iterator
- [x] list
    * [ ] iterator
- [ ] hash map
- [ ] naive binary tree
- [ ] heap
- [ ] avl + red black tree
- [ ] multiway trie
- [ ] ternary tree
- [ ] aho corasic automation
- [ ] utf-8 strings
- [ ] burrows wheeler
- [ ] huffman tree
- [ ] bloom filter
- [ ] count min sketch
- [ ] graphs
    * [ ] DFS
    * [ ] BFS
